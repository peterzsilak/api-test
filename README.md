# API test project
This is a NodeJS testing project which uses ES6, Mocha, Chai.
EcmaScript 6 features: http://es6-features.org

## NPM Packages
- @babel/cli
- @babel/core
- @babel/node - babel-node is a CLI that works exactly the same as the Node.js CLI, with the added benefit of compiling with Babel presets and plugins before running it
- @babel/preset-env - is a smart preset that allows you to use the latest JavaScript without needing to micromanage which syntax transforms (and optionally, browser polyfills) are needed by your target environment(s). This both makes your life easier and JavaScript bundles smaller!
- @babel/register
- Chai
- Mocha
